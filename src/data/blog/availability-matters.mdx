## SourceHut and CIs

Up until recently, I've been hosting this site on [SourceHut Pages](https://srht.site/).
They're strong on the FOSS movement, and I love the simplicity of their CI.
You get to choose from a variety of [runners](https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/compatibility.md)
such as Alpine, FreeBSD, NixOS, Debian, and Ubuntu.

Ever since they've [switched to physical servers](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-06-12-infrastructure-updates/#:~:text=We%20decided,workload)
for their runners, I wasn't able to build my site with `nix build`.
I discovered that the issue lies in [deadlocks](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ANixOS%2Fnix+waiting+for+locks+or+build+slots&type=issues),
possibly from the storage hardware used in their physical runner.

I empathize with their decision to move to physical servers.
CIs in general can be pretty wasteful:
each invocation will require a full `npm install` to build my website.
That's warranted in most cases,
but I think a solo project could get by with exercising some restraint on triggering deploy runners.

## A new build environment

Regardless, I'm moving to GitHub for my website.
The code is now [open source](https://github.com/mkamsani/baraqkamsani.com);
my GitHub Actions calls `netlify-cli` to deploy to Netlify pages.
That gives me more freedom to work with glue code in `deploy.yaml`,
and I get the SSR benefits from Netlify.

At the same time,
I've also simplified the CSS and functionalities on my site.
There's only two types of pages: a blog page (you're reading it now), and my homepage.

## Moving Slow

I think admitting this is like bitter medicine.
It's fairly trivial to slap a blog template and call it a day,
but to **copy a design is hard**.
Design systems are hard, rolling your own components is hard, and CSS takes time.

I've tried the Tailwind/UnoCSS route and hacked a site in a few days.
I got results,
but my process paid no attention to how I'm going to maintain this code.
Revisiting the code made me realize I ought to be more mindful of the process.
This time,
I've decided to build my site without Tailwind[^1] and with minimal reliance on external libraries.
It'll take me more time to layer things on top of one another,
but I think I've done the base (homepage and blog posts) decently.
Everything that follows are nice-to-haves.

## Roadmap

In the future,
I hope to add the following functionalities (non-exhaustive):

- CSS-only dropdowns with the [anchor positioning API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor)
- Post [comments that work with static sites](https://darekkay.com/blog/static-site-comments/#self-hosted)
- [Sidenotes](https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/)
- Better support for PDF rendering with `@media print`
- [Interactive](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi) code snippets

Further down-the-road,
I'd like to turn all of this into a reusable blog template.
That deserves a design document of its own I guess.

[^1]: Tailwind is fine, I just like writing vanilla CSS in general.
